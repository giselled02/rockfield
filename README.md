# Rockfield Cottage

This website is to promote my family home that is currently up for rent in Kinvara, Galway. This recently renovated house is the perfect countryside getaway.
Users of his website can find useful informtion about this house including check-in times, amenities and photos. It also links the airbnb page where you an actually rent.



## Features

### Navigation
I took inspiration from the Love Running walkthrough project while adding my own style to it. Shown at the top left page while on phones and tablets/ipads, then centered on latops and larger, is the title of our pge with the navigation menu to the right.
In the navigation menu you will find 'home' which will take you to the home index.html page, 'gallery' where you will find photos of the house, then the final link 'book your stay' will bring you to the airbnb webpage where you can rent the house.

### Hero
The hero image shows a captivating image of the front of the house and includes basic information about the house; where it is located and how many guests it supports.

### Intro
Next is an introduction to the house that paints a picture of what guests culd get up to while stayig here.

### House rules
I included some useful details that people would like to know while making a decision about whether this would be the right rental for them including information about check in/out times and that the rental is pet friendly.

### Photo break
To make the website more visually completed I added of the interior of the house as a break between information

### The space
I added some more information on the house which included adding an unordered list that highlights some items and features that are included once you book your stay.

### Amenities
I used the font awesome website to find icons that correlated to some amenities that come with the house (I wasn't able to include all as there were only a limited amount of free icons).
The area looked quite elongated when it came to larger laptp screens so I made this section centered so it was easier to read

### Competition form
I used my knowledge of different form inputs to create a competition form where someone could win a free stay.

### Map
I remembered embedding a Google Maps map to the coders coffeehouse in the html lessons so i included a satellite map of the house to my website.

### Footer
I added a copyright icon and social media icons that just lead to the log in pages of each social medai platform

### Gallery
The gallery provides various pictures of the house and it's different rooms
